# 2018-bc-cancer-work-term-report-presentation

This is a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) presentation that I have
to write (and present) to satisfy my co-op requirements for the
Engineering Science deparment at SFU. The intention going in is to make
this just good enough to pass (since a co-op semester is pass/fail).
We'll see how it plays out as I write this in the coming week.

## Presenting

Install all the required node packages with

```
npm install
```

Then run the presentation locally with

```
npm start
```

Node.js should have opened up the presentation in your favourite browser
(if it didn't, point your browser to `localhost:8000`).
